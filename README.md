## ‚ú® About The Project

SecureSight is a comprehensive solution for modern security monitoring. Traditional CCTV systems often have clunky, slow interfaces. This project re-imagines the experience with a fluid, real-time dashboard that allows security operators to track, review, and resolve incidents with maximum efficiency.

Key design principles include:
* **‚ö° Real-time First:** Data synchronization and live updates are core to the experience.
* **Intuitive UX:** A highly interactive timeline and integrated player make incident review seamless.
* **Optimistic UI:** Actions feel instantaneous, providing immediate feedback to the user while data synchronizes in the background.
* **Type-Safe & Robust:** Leveraging TypeScript and Prisma from front to back ensures code quality and maintainability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built on a modern, full-stack architecture using Next.js API Routes as the backend, with all database interactions handled safely through Prisma.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

This project has a solid foundation. Here are some features planned for the future:

* [ ] **Authentication:** Implement NextAuth.js with role-based access for operators and admins.
* [ ] **Real-time Updates:** Integrate WebSockets (e.g., via Supabase Realtime) for live incident feeds without manual refreshing.
* [ ] **Advanced Analytics:** A dedicated analytics page with charts for incident trends and camera uptime.
* [ ] **PWA Support:** Add a service worker and manifest file for offline capabilities and a native-like mobile experience.
* [ ] **Notifications:** Implement email or push notifications for critical incidents.
* [ ] **Comprehensive Testing:** Add end-to-end tests with Playwright and unit tests with Jest/RTL.
* [ ] **Performance Caching:** Implement Redis for caching expensive API queries.
